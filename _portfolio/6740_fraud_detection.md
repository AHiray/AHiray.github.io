## Abstract
Credit card fraud detection is a critical concern for financial institutions and individuals due to its significant financial impact and potential harm to personal credit. Machine learning has emerged as a promising solution for credit card fraud detection, leveraging its ability to analyze large datasets and identify complex patterns and anomalies. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the application of machine learning algorithms for credit card fraud detection, including data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation. Several machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost, are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising historical credit card transactions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in detecting credit card fraud, with variations in performance across different algorithms, and provide insights into the impact of data preprocessing techniques and the performance of different models. By leveraging the power of machine learning, financial institutions can mitigate financial losses, protect their customers, and maintain trust in the credit card industry.
