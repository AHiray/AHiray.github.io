Abstract

The last decade has seen the blockchain ecosystem arise as an emerging market fostering new technology and talent. At the forefront of this ecosystem lies the unprecedented growth of the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin (BTC) has been accepted as the de facto standard for cryptocurrencies, the rapid proliferation of cryptocurrencies has produced far more advanced and efficient innovative coins. Many cryptocurrencies in this newer generation have begun to gain traction as viable alternatives to their predecessors. The adoption of newer coins necessitates a re-evaluation of which cryptocurrencies command the market. Such insight is crucial for understanding the direction blockchain technology is headed. Analyzing the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market from a network science perspective provides insight into the complex underlying relationships among cryptocurrencies. Through this research, we explore the growth of the cryptocurrency market from a network science perspective. Using hourly data of the top 250 coins from 2016 to 2022, we build Planar Maximally Filtered Graphs using rolling correlation to identify highly influential coins. We see that over time, the market is becoming increasingly correlated and that following shock events cryptocurrencies move in a synchronous nature. We also find that although BTC remains the largest by market cap, various metrics show ETH as well as newer coins having a larger influence on the market more recently.
