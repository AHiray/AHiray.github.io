I am an undergraduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am majoring in Industrial Engineering (Advanced Studies in Operations Research and Statistics) and Mathematics (Probability and Statistics). I am an undergraduate researcher and my research is mainly focused on application of network science to financial markets as well as optimizing mathematical modelling. 

I was honored with 'Fintech Fellow' at Georgia Tech Financial Services Innovation Lab (FSIL) for my contribution to research. I am associated with FSIL sicne my freshman year and has been actively involved in research since then. 

I am interested in researching stochastic processes at the intersection of probability, statistics, and optimization to advance methods for understanding interconnectedness in financial markets.
